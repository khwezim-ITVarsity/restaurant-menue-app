                    <ol>
                        <li>Cut the onions into small chunks. Deseed the bell pepper and cut it into large pieces. Please place them in a baking tray on the oven’s top rack to broil until they are partially charred. Remove and let it cool.</li>
                        
                        <li>Remove the stems and seeds of the large red chilies and bird’s eye chilies. You may consider wearing a glove to avoid the burning feeling. You can also rub your hands with oil before handling the chili if you do not want to use the glove.</li>
                        
                        <li>Place the chili, onion, garlic, vinegar, part of the lemon juice, and other spices listed in the recipe into a blender or food processor. Blend for two minutes or until it turns into a smooth paste.</li>
                        
                        <li>Bring it to a boil and simmer over low heat for ten to ten minutes to break down the ingredients. You must keep stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the pot, especially in the final few minutes when the sauce has become thicker.</li>
                        
                        <li>Discard the bay leaves, Transfer the cooked sauce back to the blender,
                            Add the remaining lemon juice, lemon zest, and olive oil,
                            Blender for half a minute, and the peri-peri sauce is done.
</li>
                    </ol>
